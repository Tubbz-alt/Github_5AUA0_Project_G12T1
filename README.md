# Project for the course 5AUA0
Group 12, Team 1: Kevin and Nadine

## Topic: Multiple-object re-identification using deep learning.
Our goal is to find the best method to generate the identity embeddings for one-shot multiple-object tracking.

## Google Drive and Google Colab
We work in Google Colab combined with Google Drive and GitHub. The Notebook "5AUA0_Project_hrnet.ipynb" is used to run code, train and evaluate models.

## Baseline model
We use FairMOT as our baseline.

### Download their pretrained and baseline model
Follow their instructions for downloading the model and put them in the structure they explain.

For pretrained model get:
- HRNetV2 ImageNet pretrained model

And for baseline model get:
- HRNetV2_W18
